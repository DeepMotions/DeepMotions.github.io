        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Sven founded DeepMotions in 2015.<br>
          The idea of DeepMotions is to discover unknown and small artists in Future House &amp; Deep House genres, who want to share their music with the world.
          DeepMotions strives to help these producers by giving them a platform to do this on.<br><br>
          We at DeepMotions aim to create the best music selection around the globe to help you through your day.<br><br>
          Sven added Hidde to the team in 2016 after discovering him through a design query. Hidde &amp; Sven have a still ongoing partnership and DeepMotions grew even bigger than they could have ever imagined. We hope that we can reach even more people, but to do so we're going to need your help!
