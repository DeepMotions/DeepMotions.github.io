        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>DeepMotions was founded by Sven in 2015 with the concept of discovering unknown and small artists in future house &amp; deep house genres, who want to share their music with the world.
          DeepMotions strives to help these producers by giving them a platform to share their music on.<br><br>
          We at DeepMotions aim to create the best music selection around the globe to help you through your day. If you feel like your music fits into our concept, don't hesitate and submit a track on our <a href="submission.html">music submission</a> page.<br><br>
          Sven added Hidde to the team in 2016 after discovering him through a design query. Hidde &amp; Sven have a still ongoing partnership and DeepMotions grew even bigger than they could have ever imagined. We hope that we can reach even more people, but to do so we're going to need your help!<br><br>
