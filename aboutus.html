        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>In 2015, Sven founded DeepMotions.<br>
          The idea of DeepMotions is to discover unknown, young artists, who want to share their music with the world.
          DeepMotions strives to help these producers by giving them a platform to do this on.<br><br>
          We strive to create the best music selection around the globe. Also to help all of you to get through your day.<br><br>
          In 2016, Sven came across Hidde through a design query and decided to bring him on board of DeepMotions. Hidde &amp; Sven had a fine partnership and DeepMotions grew even bigger than they could have ever imagined. They hope it will grow even further.
